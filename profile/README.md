## Welcome at the DIVERSIFIX code repositories ðŸ‘‹

Diversifix is an association that develops technology for inclusive language. We are continuing the vision that has been started with the Tech4Germany prototype INCLUSIFY.

At the moment we are restructuring our code repositories for better long-term development and they may not be functional or well-documented.

For the meantime, check out our [website](https://diversifix.org) and the code repository of [INCLUSIFY](https://github.com/tech4germany/bam-inclusify).
